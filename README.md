# HealthyKitten
An iOS test app for testing HealthKit.

### Overview

The app monitors whenever it receives a Health Kit Observer Query Event (regardless if the app is in the background or currently active) and saves these events in a list. 

You can use the app to test how HealthKit Observer Query delivers the events.
